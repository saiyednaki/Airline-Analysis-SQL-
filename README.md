**Airline Occupancy Rate & Revenue Analysis**

**Project Overview**

The airline industry is facing increasing pressure due to environmental regulations, rising fuel prices, higher taxes, and increased labor costs. These factors have significantly impacted profitability.
This project analyzes airline operational and revenue data to identify opportunities to increase aircraft occupancy rates, thereby improving average profit per seat without compromising customer experience or safety.

The analysis focuses on understanding ticket bookings, fare structures, aircraft capacity, revenue trends, and occupancy performance across different aircraft types.

**Business Problem**

  - The company operates a mixed fleet of aircraft with varying seat capacities and fare conditions. Despite steady demand, profitability is under pressure due to:
  - Stricter environmental regulations
  - Higher flight taxes
  - Rising fuel and labor costs
  - Changing customer preferences
  - To address these challenges, the company aims to increase occupancy rates on low-performing flights and optimize pricing strategies to improve overall revenue.

**Objectives**

  - Increase aircraft occupancy rate to boost profit per seat
  - Analyze ticket bookings and revenue trends over time
  - Compare fare pricing across aircraft and fare classes
  - Identify low-performing aircraft and improvement opportunities
  - Estimate revenue impact of a 10% increase in occupancy

**Tools & Skills**
  - SQL / Data Analysis
  - Aggregations & KPIs
  - Revenue & occupancy analysis

**Methodology**
1. Basic Data Analysis
  - Identified aircraft with more than 100 seats
  - Analyzed seat capacity by aircraft type
  - Calculated total tickets booked and revenue trends

2. Revenue & Pricing Analysis
  - Compared average fare prices across fare classes
  - Analyzed revenue distribution by aircraft
  - Identified pricing patterns influencing demand

3. Occupancy Rate Analysis
  - Calculated occupancy rate as:
  - Occupancy Rate = Booked Seats / Total Seats
  - Compared occupancy performance across aircraft
  - Identified underutilized aircraft

4. Scenario Analysis
  - Simulated a 10% increase in occupancy rate
  - Estimated potential revenue growth
  - Assessed feasibility of pricing-based improvements

**Key Insights**
  - Aircraft with lower fares tend to achieve higher ticket sales
  - Business class fares are consistently higher than economy across all aircraft
  - Some aircraft generate high revenue due to higher demand, not higher prices
  - Aircraft with limited fare options and lower service quality show lower revenue
  - A 10% increase in occupancy results in a noticeable and consistent revenue increase

**Recommendations**
  - Optimize pricing based on aircraft condition, facilities, and demand
  - Avoid extremely low or high pricing, as both reduce customer interest
  - Focus marketing and pricing efforts on low-occupancy flights
  - Improve customer experience to support higher occupancy sustainably
  - Use data-driven pricing strategies rather than uniform fare adjustments

**Conclusion**

Improving occupancy rates is a powerful lever for increasing airline profitability. This analysis demonstrates that strategic pricing optimization and targeted improvements can significantly boost revenue without increasing operational costs.
A balanced, data-driven approach enables airlines to remain competitive while maintaining customer satisfaction and safety standards.
